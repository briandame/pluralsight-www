# Pluralsight Coding Challenge - Front End

Angular application that consumes the questions back end API.

This application provides a front end to manage questions, answers, and distractors. The following operations are supported:

- View all questions
- Create a new question
- Edit an existing question
- Delete an existing question

While the REST service supports pagination, I did not have time to implement it in the Angular application.
